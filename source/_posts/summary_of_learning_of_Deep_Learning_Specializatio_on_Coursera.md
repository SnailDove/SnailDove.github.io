This is my summary of learning [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) on Coursera, which consists of 5 courses as following:
- 1st course: [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning)
- 2nd course: [Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization](https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-neural-network)
- 3rd course: [Structuring Machine Learning Projects](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-projects)
- 4th course: [Convolutional Neural Networks](https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks)
- 5th course: [Sequence Models](https://www.coursera.org/learn/nlp-sequence-models)

And, my summaries of them are here:

- 1st course: [summary_of_neural-networks-deep-learning](/2018/02/08/summary_of_neural-networks-deep-learning/)
- 2nd course: [summary_of_Improving-Deep-Neural-Networks](/2018/03/02/summary_of_Improving-Deep-Neural-Networks/)
- 3rd course: [summary_of_Structuring-Machine-Learning-Projects](/2018/04/03/summary_of_Structuring-Machine-Learning-Projects/)
- 4th course: [summary_of_convolutional-neural-networks](/2018/05/04/summary_of_convolutional-neural-networks/)
- 5th course: [summary_of_nlp-sequence-models](/2018/06/06/summary_of_nlp-sequence-models/)

I spent about 45 days in finishing this Deep learning Specialization, and writing out the personal lecture notes, summaries and assignments, but as the saying goes, "gain new knowledge by reviewing old". Therefore, I will stick at learning more about Deep Learning and renew the content of this specilization.

if you need more details about this Deep Learning Specilization in English, please refer [deeplearning.ai](https://deeplearning.ai) or [the specialization on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning).

本文是我个人对吴恩达的深度学习专项课程的学习总结，此文有5个子课程，总结如下：

- 1st course: [summary_of_neural-networks-deep-learning](/2018/02/08/summary_of_neural-networks-deep-learning/)
- 2nd course: [summary_of_Improving-Deep-Neural-Networks](/2018/03/02/summary_of_Improving-Deep-Neural-Networks/)
- 3rd course: [summary_of_Structuring-Machine-Learning-Projects](/2018/04/03/summary_of_Structuring-Machine-Learning-Projects/)
- 4th course: [summary_of_convolutional-neural-networks](/2018/05/04/summary_of_convolutional-neural-networks/)
- 5th course: [summary_of_nlp-sequence-models](/2018/06/06/summary_of_nlp-sequence-models/)

此专项课程的中文目录如下:

如果需要详细视频内容和课程ppt，请参考[网易云课堂：吴恩达给你的人工智能第一课](https://mooc.study.163.com/smartSpec/detail/1001319001.htm)， 但是网易并没有提供完成作业的平台，完成作业还需要到 [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)。
